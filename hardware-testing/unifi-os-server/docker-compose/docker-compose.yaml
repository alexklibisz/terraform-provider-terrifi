# UniFi controller in host networking mode.
#
# Host networking lets UniFi devices on the local network discover and
# communicate with the controller directly. Use Tailscale on the host
# itself if you also need remote access to the management UI.
#
# Quick start:
#   1. Copy .env.example to .env and set TZ
#   2. docker compose up -d
#   3. Access the UI at https://<host-ip>:8443
